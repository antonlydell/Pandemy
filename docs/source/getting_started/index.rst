This chapter describes how to install Pandemy and showcases a brief overview of saving a
:class:`pandas.DataFrame` to and reading a :class:`pandas.DataFrame` from a SQLite database.
A teaser for what the :doc:`User guide <../user_guide/index>` has to offer.

Throughout this documentation ``$`` will be used to distinguish a shell prompt from Python code
and ``>>>`` indicates a Python interactive shell. ``$`` and ``>>>`` should *not* be copied
from the examples when trying them out on your own.
